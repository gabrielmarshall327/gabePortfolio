            is a student led organization I am part of that works with various
            companies and clients to create a solution. While gaining
            professional experience by working for companies, this is also
            giving back to people by coming up with free solutions. Currently, I
            am working a AI medical wristband for a company called Nurowerx and
            previously was working with a start-up company to create a smart
            plant pot by designing and creating a mobile application that
            connected to the plant pot.

            is a massive volunteering opportunity available to Texas A&M
            students with the sole purpose of giving back to the Bryan/College
            Station community. This is an annual event that averages almost
            15,000 student volunteers. It has become one of the biggest one-day,
            student-ran events in the world while being done by the best
            university. The work is usually yard work, painting, or possibly
            building.

            is a non-profit animal shelter in Bryan/College Station. The shelter
            takes in almost any kind of animals, ranging from dogs and cats to
            pigs and chickens. This was started during my freshmen year of high
            school since volunteering was a strict requirement to graduate.
            However, I still volunteer there today to see all the new animals
            that arrive and hopefully get to adopt one someday!

            is another student led organization that is focused on teaching and
            creating coding projects. The organization will take anyone, no
            matter how experienced with coding. For example, during my sophomore
            year, I was able to be part of the Build-a-Rocket team and now
            mentor for that project. I was also part of creating a mobile app,
            Paw, my freshmen year which thought me a ton of full-stack
            development. There are also various workshops held, ranging from web
            development, AI, game development, discord bots and much more.
